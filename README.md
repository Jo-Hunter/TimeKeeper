# TimeKeeper
Windows application to record time spent in various tasks, eg, freelance projects

This project is the program I am currently working on. 
It is not ready to take any contributions and is basically public to showcase examples of my work.

The program asks that you set a topic and a project and press a button to start/stop the timer.
It also allows for the recording of URLs and file locations.
The topics, projects, files, sessions and links can be edited - add, update, delete, search.
A report can be made, filtered as you want.

At this point in time, sessions can be started and stopped.
